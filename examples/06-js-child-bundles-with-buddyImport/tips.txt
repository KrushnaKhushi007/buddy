#JS CHILD BUNDLES WITH buddyImport#

The config for this example describes a single JS build:

{{buddy}}

The input file (`index.js`) has one static dependency (`arrify`), and one dynamic dependency
(`./child`) declared with `buddyImport()`. The child input file (`child.js`) has one dependency (`arrify`),
but because it is already bundled into `www/output.js`, it is not included in the child bundle:

  - child bundles are automatically generated from `buddyImport()` expressions
  - at runtime, bundles are loaded and evaluated dynamically
  - load location at runtime may be configured with `server.webroot`
  - dynamically generated bundles are given a unique output name based on id and contents
  - `buddyImport` works in all three environments (Node.js, web worker, web page)
  - `buddyImport` boilerplate is only included in the root bundle
  - `buddyImport` may require a `Promise` polyfill in some environments
