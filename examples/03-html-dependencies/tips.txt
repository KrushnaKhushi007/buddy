#HTML DEPENDENCIES#

The config for this example describes a single HTML build:

{{buddy}}

The input file (`index.html`) has two dependencies (`dep.css`, `arrify`),
and all files are bundled together as `www/output.html`:

  - dependencies are declared with `inline` attributes in `<link>`, `<script>`, and `<img>` tags
  - npm installed dependencies may also be included (`<script inline src="arrify">`)
  - bitmap images are inlined as base64 strings
  - SVG images are inlined as inline SVG elements
