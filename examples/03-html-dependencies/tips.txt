#HTML DEPENDENCIES#

The config for this example points to a single HTML file:

{buddy}

The input file (`index.html`) has one dependency (`dep.css`),
and both files are bundled together as `output.html`:

  - dependencies are declared with `inline` attributes in `<link>`, `<script>`, and `<img>` tags
  - npm installed dependencies may also be included (`<script inline src="arrify">`)
  - bitmap images are inlined as base64 strings
  - SVG images are inlined as inline SVG elements

#INPUT#

{index}

#OUTPUT#
