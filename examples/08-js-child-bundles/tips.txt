#JS CHILD BUNDLES#

The config for this example describes a JS build with a nested child build:

{{buddy.js}}

The input file (`index.js`) has two dependencies (`./child` and `arrify`),
but because `child.js` is defined as it's own build, only `arrify` and `index`
modules are bundled into `www/output.js`. The child input file (`child.js`) has one dependency
(`arrify`), but because it is already bundled into `output.js`, it is not included in `www/child-output.js`:

  - parent bundles do not include their child modules
  - child modules do not include any modules already included in a parent bundle
  - there are no limits to the number of nested build levels
  - boilerplate is only included in the root bundle
  - `require` statements are preserved to access modules accross bundles
  - loading of child bundles is not done automatically
