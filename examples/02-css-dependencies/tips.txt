#CSS DEPENDENCIES#

The config for this example points to a single CSS file:

{buddy}

The input file (`index.css`) has one dependency (`dep.css`),
and both files are bundled together as `output.css`:

  - dependencies are declared with `@import` statements
  - npm installed dependencies may also be included (`@import 'mocha/mocha.css'`)
  - due to the cascading nature of CSS, dependencies are inlined rather than concatenated
  - duplicate `@import` statements will result in duplicate file content

#INPUT#

{index}

#OUTPUT#

{output}
