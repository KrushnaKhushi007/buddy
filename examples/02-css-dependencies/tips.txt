#CSS DEPENDENCIES#

The config for this example describes a single CSS build:

{{buddy}}

The input file (`index.css`) has two dependencies (`dep`, `mocha/mocha.css`),
and all files are bundled together as `www/output.css`:

  - dependencies are declared with `@import` statements
  - npm installed dependencies may also be included (`@import 'mocha/mocha.css'`)
  - due to the cascading nature of CSS, dependencies are inlined rather than concatenated
  - duplicate `@import` statements will result in duplicate file content
