#VERSIONING#

The config for this example points to a single JS file:

{buddy}

The input file (`index.js`) is processed and saved as `output.js`
in a version of JavaScript specified under `version`:

  - both JS and CSS builds can specify a version target
  - for JS, target versions are based on official JavaScript versions (`es5`, `es2016`, etc.)
  - Node.js code may also be targeted with specific major versions (`node4`, `node6`)
  - both JS and CSS builds may specify autoprefixer-style browser versions (`["last 2 versions", "iOS >= 7"]`)
  - JS code is transpiled with Babel, and any `babelHelpers` boilerplate is included
