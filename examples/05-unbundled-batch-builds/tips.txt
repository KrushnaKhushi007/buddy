#UNBUNDLED BATCH BUILDS#

The config for this example describes a single directory (batch) build:

{{buddy.js}}

All files in the `src` directory are processed, but because the `bundle` property is `false`,
all files are output to `www`:

  - unbundled files will not inline or concatenate dependencies
  - unbundled builds are useful when transpiling or converting from another file type
