#JS DEPENDENCIES#

The config for this example describes a single JS build:

{{buddy.js}}

The input file (`index.js`) has two dependencies (`./dep` and `arrify`),
and all files are bundled together as `www/output.js`:

  - dependencies are declared with `require` (or es6 `import`) statements
  - npm installed packages are resolved the same as in Node.js (`require('arrify')`)
  - `require`, `module`, and `exports` references are inlined (`$m['index'].exports`)
  - all files are concatenated and flattened into the same scope
  - all declarations in module scope are namespaced to avoid collisions (`index__dep`)
  - `require` boilerplate is included for three environments (Node.js, web worker, web page)
  - all code is wrapped in an function to prevent potential collisions with other running JavaScript
  - modules are globally defined, and may be required from other scripts (`require('index')`)
