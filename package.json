	"readme": "# buddy(1)\n\n**buddy(1)** is a build tool for js/css projects. It helps you manage third-party dependencies, compiles source code from higher order js/css languages (coffeescript/stylus/less), automatically wraps js files in module definitions, statically resolves module dependencies, and concatenates (and optionally compresses) all souces into a single file for more efficient delivery to the browser.\n\n**Current version:** 0.6.1\n*[the 0.5.x+ branch is not backwards compatible with earlier versions. See __Change Log__ below for more details]*\n\n## Installation\n\nUse the *-g* global flag to make the **buddy(1)** command available system-wide:\n\n```bash\n$ npm -g install buddy\n```\n\nOr, optionally, add **buddy** as a dependency in your project's *package.json* file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"myproject\",\n  \"description\": \"This is my web project\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"buddy\": \"0.5.0\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"install\": \"buddy install\",\n    \"build\": \"buddy build\",\n    \"deploy\": \"buddy deploy\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n...then install:\n\n```bash\n$ cd path/to/project\n$ npm install\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n$ cd path/to/project\n\n# When buddy is installed globally:\n# install dependencies\n$ buddy install\n# build all source files\n$ buddy build\n# build and compress all source files\n$ buddy -c build\n# build and lint all source files\n$ buddy -l build\n# build all source files and execute\n# the 'test' command defined in config\n$ buddy -t build\n# build all source files with verbose notifications\n$ buddy -v build\n# watch and build on source changes\n$ buddy watch\n# build and compress for production\n$ buddy deploy\n# list all generated files\n$ buddy ls\n# remove all generated files\n$ buddy clean\n# view usage, examples, and options\n$ buddy --help\n\n# When buddy is installed locally:\n# ...if scripts parameter defined in package.json\n$ npm run-script install\n# ...if called directly\n$ ./node_modules/buddy/bin/buddy install\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe only requirement for adding **buddy** support to a project is the presence of a **buddy.js** file in your project root:\n\n```js\n// Project build configuration.\nexports.build = {\n  js: {\n    // Directories containing potential js source files for this project.\n    sources: ['a/coffeescript/source/directory', 'a/js/source/directory'],\n    // One or more js build targets.\n    targets: [\n      {\n        // An entrypoint js (or equivalent) file to be wrapped in a module definition,\n        // concatenated with all it's resolved dependencies.\n        input: 'a/coffeescript/or/js/file',\n        // A destination in which to save the processed input.\n        // If a directory is specified, the input file name will be used.\n        output: 'a/js/file/or/directory',\n        // Targets can have children.\n        // Any sources included in the parent target will NOT be included in the child.\n        targets: [\n          {\n            input: 'a/coffeescript/or/js/file',\n            output: 'a/js/file/or/directory'\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        // Files are batch processed when a directory is used as input.\n        input: 'a/coffeescript/or/js/directory',\n        output: 'a/js/directory',\n        // Skips module wrapping (ex: for use in server environments).\n        modular: false\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  css: {\n    // Directories containing potential css source files for this project.\n    sources: ['a/stylus/directory', 'a/less/directory', 'a/css/directory'],\n    // One or more css build targets\n    targets: [\n      {\n        // An entrypoint css (or equivalent) file to be processed,\n        // concatenated with all it's resolved dependencies.\n        input: 'a/stylus/less/or/css/file',\n        // A destination in which to save the processed input.\n        // If a directory is specified, the input file name will be used.\n        output: 'a/css/file/or/directory'\n      },\n      {\n        // Files are batch processed when a directory is used as input.\n        input: 'a/stylus/less/or/css/directory',\n        output: 'a/css/directory'\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n// Project dependency configuration.\nexports.dependencies = {\n  // A destination directory in which to place third-party library dependencies.\n  'a/vendor/directory': {\n    // An ordered list of dependencies\n    sources: [\n      // A github user/repo.\n      // Install the 'browser-require' source when using Node-style modules.\n      'popeindustries/browser-require',\n      // A named library with or without version (ex: jquery@latest, backbone, backbone@1.0.0).\n      // Version identifiers follow the npm semantic versioning rules.\n      'library@version'\n    ],\n    // Dependencies can be packaged and minified to a destination file\n    output: 'a/js/file'\n  },\n  // A destination directory in which to place source library dependencies.\n  'a/source/directory': {\n    sources: [\n

user/repo with specific file or directory locations.\n      'username/repo#a/file/or/directory|another/file/or/directory',\n      // A local file or directory to copy and install.\n      'a/file/or/directory'\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n// Project settings configuration.\nexports.settings = {\n  // Run a command after build\n  test: 'command --flags',\n  // Override the default plugins, and/or include custom plugins.\n  plugins: {\n    js: {\n      // Append one or more js compilers to the default 'coffeescript'.\n      compilers: ['a/file', 'another/file'],\n      // Change the default 'uglifyjs' compressor to a custom specification.\n      compressor: 'a/file',\n      // Change the default 'jshint' linter to a custom specification.\n      linter: 'a/file',\n      // Change the default 'node' module type to 'amd' or a custom specification.\n      module: 'amd'\n    },\n    css: {\n      // Append one or more css compilers to the default 'stylus' and 'less'.\n      compilers: ['a/file', 'another/file'],\n      // Change the default 'cleancss' compressor to a custom specification.\n      compressor: 'a/file',\n      // Change the default 'csslint' linter to a custom specification.\n      linter: 'a/file'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Concepts\n\n### BUILD\n\n**Project Root**: The directory from which all paths resolve to. Determined by location of the *buddy.js* configuration file.\n\n**Sources**: An array of directories from which all referenced files are retrieved from. ***Note:*** A *js* module's id is derived from it's relative path to it's source directory.\n\n**Targets**: Objects that specify the *input* and *output* files or directories for each build. Targets are built in sequence, allowing builds to be chained together. ***Note:*** A *js* target can also have nested child targets, ensuring that dependencies are not duplicated across related builds.\n\n**Target parameters**:\n\n- *input*: file or directory to build. If js (or equivalent) file, all dependencies referenced will be concatenated together for output.\nIf directory, all compileable files will be compiled, wrapped in module definitions (js), and output to individual js/css files.\n\n- *output*: file or directory to output to.\n\n- *targets*: a nested target that prevents the duplication of source code with it's parent target.\n\n- *modular*: a flag to prevent js files from being wrapped with a module definition.\n\n### MODULES\n\nEach js file is wrapped in a module declaration based on the file's location. Dependencies (and concatenation order) are determined by the use of ```require()``` statements:\n\n```javascript\nvar lib = require('./my/lib'); // in current package\nvar SomeClass = require('../someclass'); // in parent package\nvar util = require('utils/util'); // from root package\n\nlib.doSomething();\nvar something = new SomeClass();\nutil.log('hey');\n```\n\nSpecifying a module's public behaviour is achieved by decorating an ```exports``` object:\n\n```javascript\nvar myModuleVar = 'my module';\n\nexports.myModuleMethod = function() {\n  return myModuleVar;\n};\n```\n\n...or overwriting the ```exports``` object completely:\n\n```javascript\nfunction MyModule() {\n  this.myVar = 'my instance var';\n};\n\nMyModule.prototype.myMethod = function() {\n  return this.myVar;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = MyModule;\n```\n\nEach module is provided with a ```module```, ```exports```, and ```require``` reference.\n\nWhen ```require()```-ing a module, keep in mind that the module id is resolved based on the following rules:\n\n * packages begin at the root folder specified in *buddy.js > js > sources*:\n```\n'Users/alex/project/src/package/main.js' > 'package/main'\n```\n * uppercase filenames are converted to lowercase module ids:\n```\n'my/package/Class.js' > 'my/package/class'\n```\n\nSee [node.js modules](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.8.0/api/modules.html) for more info on modules.\n\n***NOTE***: ```require``` boilerplate needs to be included on the page to enable module loading. It's recommended to ```install``` a library like *popeindustries/browser-require*.\n\n### DEPENDENCIES\n\nDependency resources are installed from local locations or remotely from Github.\n\n**Sources**: An array of local or remote resource locations.\n\n- **destination**: each group of sources will be installed to the project relative location specified.\n\n- **identifier**: github ```username/repo``` identifiers are preferred, but it is also possible to use identifiers from the [bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower) package manager: ```'jquery', 'backbone', 'underscore'```\n\n- **versioning**: github sources can specify a version by appending ```@``` and a npm-style symantic version: ```'*', '1.2.3', '1.x', '~1.2.0', '>=1.2.3'```\n\n- **resources**: specific resources can be specified by appending ```#``` and a list of ```|``` separated relative file or directory locations: ```'username/repo#a/file/or/directory|another/file/or/directory'```\n\n**Output**: A file destination to concatenate and compress the source contents. The order of *sources* determines the content order.\n\n## Examples\n\nCopy project boilerplate from a local directory:\n\n```js\nexports.dependencies = {\n  '.': {\n    sources: ['../../boilerplate/project']\n  }\n}\n```\n\nGrab js dependencies to be installed and packaged for inclusion in html:\n\n```js\nexports.dependencies = {\n  // install location\n  'libs/vendor': {\n    sources: [\n      // library for require boilerplate\n      'popeindustries/browser-require',\n      // jquery at specific version\n      'jquery@1.8.2'\n    ],\n    // packaged and compressed\n    output: 'www/assets/js/libs.js'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nGrab sources to be referenced in your builds:\n\n```js\nexports.dependencies = {\n  // install location\n  'libs/src/css': {\n    sources: [\n      // reference the lib/nib directory for installation\n      'visionmedia/nib#lib/nib'\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCompile a library, then reference some library files in your project:\n\n```js\nexports.build = {\n  js: {\n    sources: ['libs/src/coffee', 'libs/js', 'src'],\n    targets: [\n      {\n        // a folder of coffee files (including nested folders)\n        input: 'libs/src/coffee',\n        // a folder of compiled js files\n        output: 'libs/js'\n      },\n      {\n        // the application entry point referencing library dependencies\n        input: 'src/main.js',\n        // a concatenation of referenced dependencies\n        output: 'js/main.js'\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCompile a site with an additional widget using shared sources:\n\n```js\nexports.build = {\n  js: {\n    sources: ['src/coffee'],\n    targets: [\n      {\n        // the application entry point\n        input: 'src/coffee/main.coffee',\n        // output to main.js (includes all referenced dependencies)\n        output: 'js',\n        targets: [\n          {\n            // references some of the same sources as main.coffee\n            input: 'src/coffee/widget.coffee',\n            // includes only referenced dependencies not in main.js\n            output: 'js'\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\n**0.6.5** - December 5, 2012\n* fix for *watch* command firing repeated change events\n* fix for *watch* command not properly building targets on change\n* fix for child target building shared resources\n\n**0.6.4** - December 4, 2012\n* fix for *--test* not displaying both stdout and stderr\n* added wrapping of batch files in module definitions if *options.modular* is not false\n* fix for building targets that contain no source\n\n**0.6.3** - December 4, 2012\n* fix for *watch* command attempting to watch a source that doesn't exist\n* added support for default json config file type\n\n**0.6.2** - December 4, 2012\n* fix for css '@import' inlining\n\n**0.6.1** - December 3, 2012\n* added *--test* to watch command\n\n**0.6.0** - December 3, 2012\n* complete rewrite for async file operations\n* added *--test* flag for executing a command after build\n* added *--verbose* flag for outputting detailed notifications during build\n* added *ls* command to list all generated files\n* simplified dependency resource parsing on install;
